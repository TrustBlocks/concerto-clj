  "The Concerto metamodel as EDN.

  Concerto's metamodel is self-hosting -- it is defined in Concerto itself
  (`concerto-metamodel/lib/metamodel.cto`, 277 lines) and every parsed CTO file
  is an instance of it, serialized as JSON tagged with `$class`. That JSON is
  the stable, versioned interchange format, so it is what this namespace takes
  as input. Nothing here does I/O and nothing here shells out; see
  `concerto.cto` for getting from CTO text to this point.

  Every key in the metamodel is a legal Clojure keyword name, so JSON -> EDN is
  lossless and needs no mapping table. Values -- `$class` strings, type names,
  namespaces -- stay strings, because they are data, not structure."

  The Concerto grammar writes type references unqualified -- `superType` and

  from the enclosing model's imports. Doing that eagerly, once, is what keeps
  the registry pure data; the alternative is to keep the model's import resolver
  as a closure beside each declaration, which makes the registry unserializable
  and so unstorable, undiffable and unexportable.

  TypeIdentifier already carries an optional `namespace` in the metamodel, so a
  qualified declaration is still a legal metamodel value: nothing is mangled and
  nothing is invented. Walking on `$class` rather than on known parent fields
  covers decorator type references and map key/value types without enumerating
  every site. A name that resolves to nothing is left bare, exactly as it
