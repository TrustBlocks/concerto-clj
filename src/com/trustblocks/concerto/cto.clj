  "CTO text -> metamodel EDN, by shelling out to Accord's `concerto` CLI.

  This is the one namespace that does I/O and the one that needs Node, which is
  why it is separate: `concerto.metamodel` and `concerto.malli` take data and
  have no opinion about where it came from. Anything that can produce metamodel
  JSON can feed them -- the CLI today, an instaparse port of
  `concerto-cto/lib/parser.pegjs` later, or a JSON file someone else generated.

  The grammar is normative and it drifts; reimplementing it is a standing
  obligation to track that drift. Consuming the metamodel instead is a contract
  against a versioned artifact."
