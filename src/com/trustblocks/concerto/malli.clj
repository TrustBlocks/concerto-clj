  "Compile a Malli schema from a Concerto declaration.

  Concerto and Malli both flatten inheritance into one flat set of properties,
  so the two line up field for field -- but only because `$class` is retained to
  name the leaf type. Never infer the subtype structurally; always drive it from
  `$class`.

  `key-fn` maps a Concerto property name to whatever key the caller wants,
  including the `$` sigil names. The default, `keyword`, preserves Concerto's
  spelling exactly (`:$class`, `:businessDays`), which is lossless and needs no
  reverse mapping. A storage adapter passes its own -- XTDB, for instance, reads
  `$` as a namespace separator and lowercases camelCase, so it supplies a
  function that kebab-cases and rewrites `$class` to `:concerto/class`. Keeping
  that out of here is the whole point of the split."
